It is the beginning of 2019. I like to start a journey to work on psychology mental training starting from sports. <br>

The motivation starts from problem solving of my own housing problem, so I started to work on personal finance research. I also did case study and found out that a lot of times I had issues to learn how to deal with pressures, stress, how to handle relationship, money, work, time and my limited resource. How to work with relatives, friends, or other people and reduce my personal finance loss, loss of time and opportunity cost etc. 

One study a time. <br>
