It is the beginning of 2019. I like to start a journey to work on psychology mentral training starting from sports. <br>

The motivation starts from problem solving of my own housing problem, so I started to work on personal finance research. I also did case study and found out that a lot of times I had issues to learn how to deal with pressures, stress, how to handle relationship, money, work, time and my limited resouce. Say no to relatives, friends, or other people if need. 

One study a time. <br>
